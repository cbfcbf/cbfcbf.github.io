## About Me

I am currently a Robotics Engineer in humanoid locomotion team at Cyan Robotics. Prior to this, I was graduated as a master student from University of  Cambridge, majoring in mathematics. Before that, I obtained the dual degree at Peking University in Robotics and Finance.
My primary research goal is to leverage large-scale human data to build generalizable robots capable of performing the full spectrum of human skills.

## Research Interests

- **Robot learning:** Humanoid robot learning and control; Scaleble skill learning from scalable data; Perceptive locomotion; Humanoid-human-object interaction
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning; machine learing in asset pricing; network analysis
