  - title: Humanoid Universal Controller
    authors: This project aims to develop a universal controller for humanoid robots. The controller is designed to map expressive and diverse human motions onto the robot in real-time, enabling it to accurately track desired trajectories while maintaining dynamic balance and resisting external disturbances.

  - title: Basic Locomotion Controller
    authors: We developed a unified locomotion controller for the Orca robot that enables walking, standing, and diverse upper-body poses. The robot can resist external forces, traverse uneven grasslands, and climb 30-degree slopes. The system was later enhanced with a running gait, achieving stable operation for over one hour at the Beijing Robot Marathon.
